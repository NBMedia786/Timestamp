The case begins when Harvey's wife, Melissa Huber, reports him missing from his auto repair shop. The initial investigation reveals that Harvey's personal belongings were left behind, but he was nowhere to be found.\n\nSuspicion initially falls on an employee, Joshua Northcutt, who was one of the last people to see Harvey alive. However, the investigation takes a dark turn when Melissa reveals she has been having an affair with a family friend, Jimmy Tschoerner. Interrogations with Melissa and Josh reveal inconsistencies and point toward a complex web of relationships. CCTV footage contradicts Josh's alibi, showing him returning to the shop after claiming to have left.\n\nA major breakthrough comes from a secret phone recording provided by Jimmy's employer, in which Jimmy expresses extreme paranoia and makes incriminating statements. This leads investigators to search Jimmy's tow truck, where they find human blood. The investigation culminates in the discovery of Harvey's remains, including skull fragments, in a drainage tunnel near Interstate 35, confirming the case is a homicide.\n\nFaced with mounting circumstantial evidence, including GPS data from his phone placing him at the crime scenes, Jimmy Tschoerner strikes a plea deal for a 60-year sentence. In a chilling confession letter, he details how he lured Harvey to a secluded area, murdered him with an ax, dismembered his body, and disposed of the remains in various dumpsters around Georgetown. The motive appears to be his desire to be with Melissa. Ultimately, only Jimmy is charged, and he is convicted of first-degree murder.\n[Error] Failed to save video file to history: EXDEV: cross-device link not permitted, rename 'C:\\Users\\pc\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\uploads-Pbz0nU\\1762771085160-Harvey_HUber_Both_Intro.mp4' -> 'D:\\Timestamp\\shared\\1762771377803-d6n0jw.mp4'\n\n",

Hunter Tatum calls 911, claiming he accidentally shot his six-months-pregnant wife, Summer, during a struggle. He states that she found out he was cheating, pulled a gun on him, and it went off as he tried to disarm her. However, the investigation uncovers evidence that contradicts his story. A neighbor's security camera captures audio of Summer pleading for her life, followed by Hunter's cold \"Nope,\" and then two gunshots. Bodycam footage shows the chaotic scene, and the autopsy reveals Summer was shot twice from a distance, not during a close-range struggle as Hunter claimed. Faced with this irrefutable evidence, Hunter Tatum was found guilty of the capital murder of both his wife and their unborn child and was sentenced to 198 years in prison.\n\nThe second case begins on March 1, 2019, in San Antonio, Texas, when successful businesswoman Andreen McDonald is reported missing by friends after she fails to show up for work. Her husband, Andre McDonald, an Air Force Major, becomes the prime suspect. His behavior is highly suspicious; CCTV footage shows him purchasing a gun, a shovel, an axe, gasoline, and trash bags shortly after his wife's disappearance. He attempts to create an alibi by visiting a hospital and asking for a \"McDonald,\" but leaves when the receptionist begins to check records. After four months, Andreen's skeletal remains are found on a ranch. An autopsy reveals blunt force trauma, and evidence suggests Andre had burned her body. Phone records show a heated text argument over Andreen starting a new business without him, which ended just before her phone went dead. Andre's internet searches included \"how long does it take for a body to decompose.\" Despite the overwhelming circumstantial evidence, a jury acquitted him of murder, finding him guilty of the lesser charge of manslaughter. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison. Both cases demonstrate the power of video and digital evidence in piecing together the truth behind a killer's lies.\n[Error] Failed to save video file to history: EXDEV: cross-device link not permitted, rename 'C:\\Users\\pc\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\uploads-8V5bh7\\1762769905820-Killer_Cases_Docu.mp4' -> 'D:\\Timestamp\\shared\\1762770258400-dre6ps.mp4'\n\n",

Hunter Tatum calls 911, claiming he shot his pregnant wife, Summer, in self-defense during a struggle over a gun after she discovered he was cheating. Responding officers find Summer critically injured and arrest a hysterical Hunter. While Hunter maintains his story during interrogation, key evidence contradicts his claims. A neighbor's security camera captures audio of Summer screaming for her life, followed by two gunshots, but no sound of a struggle. Bodycam footage reveals the crime scene was chaotic, with packed bags suggesting Summer was trying to leave. An autopsy later confirms Summer was shot twice in the back of the head. Tragically, both Summer and their prematurely delivered baby die from their injuries. Faced with the irrefutable video and forensic evidence, Hunter Tatum was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to 198 years in prison.\n\nThe second case, a preview within the main program, begins in San Antonio, Texas, on March 1, 2019, when successful businesswoman Andreen McDonald is reported missing. Her husband, Air Force Major Andre McDonald, becomes the primary suspect due to his uncooperative behavior. Investigators find blood and evidence of a fire at their home. The crucial evidence comes from CCTV footage showing Andre purchasing a shovel, axe, gasoline, and other suspicious items from a Lowe's store on the night Andreen disappeared. He is arrested, and Andreen's burned, dismembered remains are found on a ranch months later. The investigation reveals the murder was motivated by Andre's anger over Andreen starting a new business without his knowledge. Despite the evidence, a jury acquitted him of murder but found him guilty of manslaughter, sentencing him to 20 years.\n[Notice] File saved to: /shared/1762197129133-lg6jc8.mp4\n\n",

Hunter called 911 claiming the shooting was accidental, occurring during a struggle after Summer found out he was having an affair. However, police bodycam footage showed a chaotic scene, and audio from a neighbor's security camera captured the horrifying moments before the shooting, where Summer can be heard pleading for her life before two gunshots ring out. Forensic evidence later confirmed she was shot twice in the back of the head, disproving Hunter's self-defense claim. The combination of the audio evidence and the autopsy report led to Hunter Tatum being found guilty of capital murder for the deaths of both his wife and their unborn child.\n\nThe second case details the murder of Andreen McDonald by her husband, Air Force Major Andre McDonald, in San Antonio, Texas. Andreen was reported missing on March 1, 2019, after failing to show up for work. Andre claimed she had left after an argument, but his behavior was highly suspicious. Investigators discovered blood evidence in their home and a \"kill kit\" (including a shovel, axe, and gasoline) in his car. CCTV footage captured Andre purchasing these items, as well as a new handgun, and making a staged, brief inquiry at a local hospital. Although Andre tried to cover his tracks, his suspicious activities and incriminating internet searches about body disposal were all caught on camera or recovered from his phone. Andreen's burned and dismembered remains were found four months later. Andre McDonald was ultimately found guilty of manslaughter and tampering with evidence and was sentenced to 25 years in prison.\n[Notice] File saved to: /shared/1762192874386-dv0nnm.mp4\n\n",

The story unfolds through police bodycam footage from the chaotic crime scene and intense interrogation room footage of the victim's husband, Aaron, and their 18-year-old son, David.\n\n**Timeline of Important Developments:**\nThe incident occurs on April 8, 2022, in Pensacola, Florida. Escambia County deputies respond to a 911 call at the Ohlson residence. They find Adriana Ohlson with a gunshot wound but still alive. Her husband, Aaron, and son, David, are present and highly emotional.\n\nAt the scene, David's suspicious question to an officer about survival rates from a \"buckshot to the chest,\" combined with his father confronting him on camera about a gun meant for \"home defense,\" immediately casts suspicion on him. Both are taken to the station for questioning.\n\nIn the interrogation room, the narrative takes a harrowing turn. Aaron receives a phone call from the hospital chaplain informing him his wife has died, causing him to break down completely. In a chilling juxtaposition, David exhibits bizarre, detached behavior. However, as the interrogation proceeds, David confesses. He details his anger over his parents' pending divorce and his mother's emotional coldness, which he blames on her friends. He admits to taking a shotgun with the initial intent of confronting his mother's best friend but returned home instead.\n\nDavid claims that during an argument, he pointed the shotgun at his mother, then at himself, and it accidentally discharged when she grabbed it. This narrative shatters when his father tells him, \"David, she's gone,\" to which David replies, \"I killed her,\" confessing directly. He breaks down, admitting it was his fault.\n\n**Main Characters:**\n- **Adriana Ohlson:** The victim of the shooting.\n- **Aaron Ohlson:** The victim's husband, whose grief turns to horror as he learns his own son is responsible for his wife's death.\n- **David Ohlson:** The 18-year-old son and perpetrator, who confesses to the shooting amidst a severe emotional and psychological crisis.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nDavid Ohlson, who had a history of severe mental health issues, pleaded no contest to manslaughter in 2023. He was sentenced to ten years in state prison, followed by community control and probation. The case ends by exposing the shocking dysfunction within the Ohlson family that led to an unthinkable act of matricide.\n",
